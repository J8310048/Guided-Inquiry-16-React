## These folders are all vite projects, cd into each folder (example: cd EASY, cd MEDIUM, cd HARD) then run npm run dev to display them on the browser.

## Read below for more instructions on how to display the MEDIUM folder project on the browser.

### Easy Folder:

This project contains the Number Incrementer. Just run cd EASY then run npm run dev. You'll see two buttons that say Add or subtract.

### Medium Folder:

This project was made using a combination of React.js, Node.js, and Tailwind. It fetches movie data using axios. The app will display search results when two things happen:

1. values are entered in the input form
2. the find button is clicked.

Instructions to Activate the Movie App:

- run cd MEDIUM
- run npm run dev
- open a second terminal in your code editor
- run cd MEDIUM
- then run node server.js

* Last step, Enjoy!

### Hard Folder:

This is a To Do List project where you can make your own personal to-do-list. You can add, edit, and delete items.
P.S. to edit the item you just added, just click that same item again.
